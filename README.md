# ADB - 360

> This project is supporting the VBD ADB 360, which strives to be a 360 degree end to end solution of Azure Databricks implementing a lakehouse on a medallion architecture, supported by Unity Catalog.
The end to end solution demonstrates the following concepts:
* CICD of Azure Databricks with infrastructure as Code (IAC) 
* CICD of a complete medallion architecture (Bronze/Silver/Gold) via Databricks Asset Bundles
* Unity Catalog Integration

## Structure of Repo

The Repository is structure into two main parts:
* [IAC](/iac-adb-360/README.md) : Infrastructure as code in directory iac-adb-360
* [Content](/bundle_adb_360/README.md) : the notebooks and workflow definitions to implement the lakehouse with the medallion architecture via Databricks Asset Bundles



Here is the overall Process:
