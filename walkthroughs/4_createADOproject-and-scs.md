## Create ADO Project

If you have already a ADO organization, go to step 2 otherwise start with:

1. Create an ADO Organization

* You'll have to have an account of some sorts either Microsoft Entra ID (work or school account) or a Microsoft Account (you can create one [here](https://signup.live.com))
* Next create an ADO Organization as described [here.](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/organizations/accounts/create-organization?view=azure-devops).

After you created your new organization or you logged on to an existing one, you should be logged on to your ADO organization now
